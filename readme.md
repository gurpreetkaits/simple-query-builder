simpleQueryBuilder is a PHP library that provides a simple and easy-to-use query builder for constructing SQL queries. It allows you to build complex SELECT queries with various conditions, joins, and more. Currently building the library, it's not available for all type of databases. Contributions are welcome ❤️

# install
You will not be able to install now, as some modifications are going on.

# note
I am adding more helper functions to the library so for now don't expect much. Thanks
